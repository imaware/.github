## Introduction
Default files for [@imaware](https://github.com/imaware) repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository in [@imaware](https://github.com/imaware) organization that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder


Note: License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.

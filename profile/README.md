By tracking your body’s vital biomarkers, our tests give you clear scientific data together with expert advice to help you navigate your way to better health.

Right now we have a few open source projects on interacting with the fhir specification from TypeScript; we hope to keep contributing open source whenever we can! Feel free to check us out, and get to know yourself better too - from the inside out. Our tests can be found here: [imaware.health](https://imaware.health)
